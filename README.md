# Password Strength Evaluation

## What I Did

- Created 15 passwords with varying complexity.
- Tested 7 passwords using an online password strength checker.
- Recorded crack times, leak status, and feedback for each tested password.
- Saved results in a CSV file (`results.csv`).
- Captured screenshots of password checks for reference.

## Passwords Tested

- apple123  
- Apple123  
- Apple@123  
- ApP!e@2025$  
- 12345678  
- Y7m$Qk#1Bn!  
- Pass@word2025  

## Key Learnings

- Password length significantly impacts security.
- Including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols strengthens passwords.
- Common words or patterns make passwords vulnerable.
- Long and random passwords offer the best protection against attacks.

## Files in this Repository
